### API Docs

#### Routes

- `/`: The root path is a redirect to `/v1/docs`
- `/docs`: Swagger Docs
- `/redoc`: Redoc Docs
- `/v1/docs`: Swagger Docs V1
- `/v1/redoc`: Redoc Docs V1
- `/health-check`: Verify sure the application is up
- `/v1/configurations/ingest`: Ingest data from Thingspeak API

## Running Docker

### How to Build Docker

```
make docker/build
```

### How to Run

```
make docker/run
```

### How to Test

```
make docker/test
```

### Recommended command to running the application

```
make docker/build && make docker/run
```

_The project will be running at `http://localhost:8000/`_

The `entrypoint` of this project is the `run.py` file on the root path.

This project needs Redis to be successful in its operation, when running the command `make docker/run` we will start Redis via docker-compose.

## Running locally
### How to Install

```
make local/install
```

### How to enter the virtual environment

```
make local/shell
```

### How to Run

```
make local/run
```

### How to Test
```
make local/test
```

### How to lint

`make docker/lint` or `make local/lint` to lint

`make docker/bandit` or `make local/bandit` to execute the bandit check

**Helpful commands**

_Please, check all available commands in the [Makefile](Makefile) for more information_.

## How to deploy

#### Kubernetes Deployment Quick Guide

This quick guide provides a summarized version of the steps to deploy your system on Kubernetes using the provided script and YAML files.

#### pre-requisites

- **Kubernetes Cluster:** Access to a Kubernetes cluster ([microK8s](https://microk8s.io/) assumed).

- **kubectl:** Installed and configured via [microk8s](https://microk8s.io/).

#### Run Deployment Script:

We provide a shell script to carry out all applications of manifests in Kubernetes, you can check the file [here](.deploy/deploy.sh)

If you want to look at the manifests that we apply to Kubernetes, you can view the YAML file [here](.deploy/deployment.yaml)

``` sh
chmod +x .deploy/deploy.sh
bash ./.deploy/deploy.sh <namespace>
```
